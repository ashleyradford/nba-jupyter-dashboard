    "## Creating Widgets that Navigate through NBA Statistics\n",

    "Downloading and using nba data from stats.nba.com to create interactive widgets that present plots analyzing the players' shots. This data is used to demonstrate data transformation and visualization via the split-apply-combine approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data download\n",
    "The `get_nba_data()` function from the helper_basketball module will be used to download multiple nba datasets that will be needed for the drop down selection widgets. These datasets incude the teams data, player data, and shots data. End visualizations will require specific selected data grabbed from the shots data, which in and of itself will require specific paramaters. Thus, after retrieving our three necessary datasets using the `get_nba_data()` function, we will create another function with three parameters (team id, name id, and game date id). This function will return the necessary parameters for a specifc team, player, and game date for the `get_nba_data()` function used to download shots data. This function, `choose_player_game()`, is tested along with `get_nba_data()` below."

    "Before continuing, it is important that we understand our data and its source. What does it represent? What do we expect to see in our dataframes? What NBA rules would affect certain numbers and labels? For example, overtime exists in the NBA and so there may be more than 4 quarters represented. We see that there are actually up to 8 represented in our `shotdata` dataframe. No surprises here. However, are players stationary throughout a season, do they stay on the same team? Those familiar with the NBA know of the trading system. Our `shotdata` once again shows this to be true. To look at a specifc example, we see that the player DeMarcus Cousins' `TEAM_NAME` column contains two teams, the Sacramento Kings and the New Orleans Pelicans. Yet, the `Players` dataframe does not support this. In fact, there only exists a row for each unique player and their latest team, so in this case DeMarcus Cousins only seems to be a part of the New Orleans Pelicans. This issue will affect our dropdown menus in that there will be no way to properly pull Cousins' shots data under the Sacramento Kings. We will address this problem by first finding all the players who were in multiple teams throughout the season and then creating a dicitonary with their namre and the previous teams' ids. "

    "In the following code, `get_visuals()` will be defined. This function will now be called with the `on_click` handler instead of `get_data()`. To summarize, this function will output two visualizations of the data requested from the dropdown menus. A more in depth description is as follows. First `get_visuals()` will take the ids of the team, player, and date that is selected. Instead of outputting it as before, `get_visuals()` will pass the ids onto `choose_player_game()` which will be passed into `get_nba_data()`. This will be done two seperate times, as each visual requires different information. At this point, data will be retrieved and will be used to create the outputted visualizations. The first visualization will be a bar chart comparing the shots made for each game of the player for the team that is selected (will be grouping by date). The chosen date, as well as its bar, will be highlighted in green. Here, one could examine how the players' shots per game vary as the season goes on. The second visualization will be specific to the date chosen (will be grouping by period). It will plot the percentages of shots made (so it will take into account the shots attempted) at each period (as well as the overtime periods) for the selected game date. Here, one could observe how the player performs as time runs out."
